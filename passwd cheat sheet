From the above image:

    Username: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.
    Password: An x character indicates that encrypted and salted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. Please note that you need to use the passwd command to computes the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file.
    User ID (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
    Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)
    User ID Info (GECOS): The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as user’s full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command.
    Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /
    Command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell. For example, sysadmin can use the nologin shell, which acts as a replacement shell for the user accounts. If shell set to /sbin/nologin and the user tries to log in to the Linux system directly, the /sbin/nologin shell closes the connection. If the user entry in the /etc/passwd file doesn’t have an entry in the shell field, the user gets a Bourne shell (/bin/sh).



Each column in /etc/passwd, delimited by a colon and it is explained in detail below.

1
Username
	User login id

2

    asterisk means the account is disabled.
