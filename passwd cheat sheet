From the above image:

    Username: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.
    Password: An x character indicates that encrypted and salted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. Please note that you need to use the passwd command to computes the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file.
    User ID (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
    Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)
    User ID Info (GECOS): The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as user’s full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command.
    Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /
    Command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell. For example, sysadmin can use the nologin shell, which acts as a replacement shell for the user accounts. If shell set to /sbin/nologin and the user tries to log in to the Linux system directly, the /sbin/nologin shell closes the connection. If the user entry in the /etc/passwd file doesn’t have an entry in the shell field, the user gets a Bourne shell (/bin/sh).



Each column in /etc/passwd, delimited by a colon and it is explained in detail below.

1
Username
	User login id

2
Password
	The password. You should see either an x, an asterisk (*), or an encrypted password. An x points to /etc/shadow for the actual password. An       
    asterisk means the account is disabled.
3
UserID
    The unique numeric user ID (UID) for that user. By default, Red Hat starts normal user IDs at 500.
4
GroupID
    The numeric group ID (GID) associated with that user. By default, RHEL creates a new group for every new user, and the number matches the UID.
5
User Info
    You can enter any information of your choice in this field. Standard options include the user's full name, telephone number, e-mail address,          physical location. Also known as GECOS field.
6 
Home Directory 
    Users home directory. RHEL places new home directories in /home/username.
7
Login Shell
    Users login shell. Default Linux shell is bash shell.

Example:

	jsmith:x:1001:1000:Joe Smith,Room 1007,(234)555-8910,(234)555-0044,email:/home/jsmith:/bin/sh
	
	The fields, in order from left to right, are:[2]
	
	    jsmith: User name: the string a user would type in when logging into the operating system: the logname. Must be unique across users listed in the file.
	    x: Information used to validate a user's password. The format is the same as that of the analogous field in the shadow password file, with the additional convention that setting it to "x" means the actual password is found in the shadow file, a common occurrence on modern systems.[3]
	    1001: user identifier number, used by the operating system for internal purposes. It must be unique as it identifies users uniquely.
	    1000: group identifier number, which identifies the primary group of the user; all files that are created by this user may initially be accessible to this group.
	    Joe Smith,Room 1007...: Gecos field, commentary that describes the person or account. Typically, this is a set of comma-separated values including the user's full name and contact details.[4]
	    /home/jsmith: Path to the user's home directory.
	    /bin/sh: Program that is started every time the user logs into the system. For an interactive user, this is usually one of the system's command line interpreters (shells).
